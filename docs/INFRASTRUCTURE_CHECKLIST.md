## ‚úÖ Validation Commands

### Quick Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run this script to validate infrastructure readiness

echo "=== SMEFlow Infrastructure Health Check ==="

# Check Docker services
echo "Checking Docker services..."
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep -E "(postgres|redis|keycloak|cerbos)"

# Check database connectivity
echo "Checking database connectivity..."
docker exec -it smeflow-postgres psql -U smeflow -d smeflow -c "SELECT 'Database OK' as status;"

# Check Redis
echo "Checking Redis..."
docker exec -it smeflow-redis redis-cli ping

# Check Keycloak
echo "Checking Keycloak..."
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/realms/smeflow/.well-known/openid_configuration

# Check Cerbos
echo "Checking Cerbos..."
curl -s http://localhost:3593/_cerbos/health | jq .

echo "=== Health Check Complete ==="
```

### Environment Validation
```bash
# Validate environment variables
python -c "
from smeflow.core.config import get_settings
settings = get_settings()
print('‚úÖ Configuration loaded successfully')
print(f'Database URL: {settings.DATABASE_URL[:20]}...')
print(f'Redis Host: {settings.REDIS_HOST}')
print(f'Keycloak URL: {settings.KEYCLOAK_URL}')
"
```
